# Product Context: Indigo Web UI

## Why This Project Exists

The Indigo Web UI project addresses several key challenges in the field of astrophotography:

1. **Complexity of Equipment Control**: Astrophotography requires coordinating multiple pieces of specialized equipment (mounts, cameras, focusers, filter wheels, etc.). Traditional control methods often involve using separate software for each device, creating a fragmented and complex user experience.

2. **Remote Operation Needs**: Many astrophotographers need to operate their equipment remotely, either from inside their homes while the equipment is outside, or from entirely different locations. This requires a reliable, web-based interface that works across devices.

3. **Workflow Inefficiency**: Astrophotography involves several repetitive tasks and workflows that benefit from automation. Without a unified interface, users must manually coordinate these workflows across different software applications.

4. **Real-time Monitoring Requirements**: Successful astrophotography sessions require constant monitoring of equipment status, image quality, and environmental conditions. A centralized dashboard for this information is essential.

## Problems It Solves

The Indigo Web UI solves these problems by:

1. **Unified Control Interface**: Providing a single, cohesive interface to control all astrophotography equipment connected to the indigosky server.

2. **Web Accessibility**: Enabling control from any device with a web browser, facilitating remote operations.

3. **Workflow Automation**: Streamlining common astrophotography tasks through automated sequences and intelligent defaults.

4. **Real-time Feedback**: Offering immediate visual feedback on equipment status, operations, and image acquisition.

5. **Equipment Compatibility**: Supporting a wide range of astronomical equipment through the indigosky server's device drivers.

## How It Should Work

The Indigo Web UI operates as a client-side application that communicates with the indigosky server:

1. **Connection Flow**:
   - User accesses the web UI through a browser
   - UI establishes a connection with the indigosky server
   - Server provides information about connected equipment
   - UI displays appropriate control panels based on available equipment

2. **Control Paradigm**:
   - Specialized panels for different equipment types (mount, camera, focuser, etc.)
   - Global status dashboard showing the state of all connected devices
   - Task-oriented workflows that coordinate multiple devices
   - Real-time updates of all parameters and status information

3. **Imaging Workflow**:
   - Equipment setup and connection
   - Target selection and framing
   - Focus optimization
   - Exposure sequence planning and execution
   - Image preview and quality assessment
   - Data management and organization

4. **Automation Capabilities**:
   - Scheduled imaging sessions
   - Automated focus adjustment
   - Meridian flip handling
   - Weather monitoring and safety shutdown
   - Dithering between exposures
   - Filter wheel sequencing

## User Experience Goals

The Indigo Web UI aims to deliver an exceptional user experience through:

1. **Intuitive Design**: Clear, logical organization of controls and information that follows the natural workflow of astrophotography.

2. **Responsive Interface**: Fast, fluid interactions that work across device sizes, from desktop monitors to mobile phones.

3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Essential controls are immediately accessible, while advanced options are available but don't overwhelm the interface.

4. **Visual Feedback**: Status indicators, progress bars, and image previews provide immediate feedback on operations.

5. **Contextual Help**: Integrated guidance and tooltips to assist users with complex operations.

6. **Customization**: User-configurable layouts and preferences to accommodate different workflows and equipment setups.

7. **Error Resilience**: Clear error messages with suggested resolutions, and graceful handling of connection issues.

8. **Accessibility**: Compliance with web accessibility standards to ensure usability for all users.

The ultimate goal is to create an interface that feels natural and intuitive to both novice and experienced astrophotographers, allowing them to focus on capturing the night sky rather than wrestling with equipment control.
