# Project Progress: Indigo Web UI

## Current Status

The Indigo Web UI project is in the **initial setup and planning phase**. We have established the project requirements, defined the architecture, and selected the technology stack. The project structure has been initialized, but active development of features has not yet begun.

### Project Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| June 2025 | Project initiated |
| June 2025 | Requirements and architecture defined |
| June 2025 | Memory bank documentation established |
| *Upcoming* | Core infrastructure implementation |
| *Upcoming* | First equipment control panel |
| *Upcoming* | Initial release |

## What Works

As the project is in its initial phase, we have the following components in place:

1. **Project Foundation**:
   - Basic project structure created with Vite, React, and TypeScript
   - Initial configuration files established
   - Memory bank documentation structure

2. **Planning and Architecture**:
   - System architecture defined
   - Component relationships mapped
   - Communication patterns established
   - Technology stack selected

## What's Left to Build

The project has a comprehensive roadmap of features to implement:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

- [ ] WebSocket connection manager
- [ ] Authentication system
- [ ] Basic state management stores
- [ ] Application shell and navigation
- [ ] Theme system (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Server connection interface
- [ ] Equipment discovery and display

### Phase 2: Equipment Control Panels

- [ ] Mount control panel
- [ ] Camera control panel
- [ ] Focuser control panel
- [ ] Filter wheel control panel
- [ ] Real-time status displays for each equipment type

### Phase 3: Imaging Workflow

- [ ] Sequence editor
- [ ] Image preview and analysis
- [ ] Plate solving integration
- [ ] Automated focusing
- [ ] Dithering control

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

- [ ] Weather monitoring
- [ ] Equipment safety controls
- [ ] Meridian flip handling
- [ ] Session planning tools
- [ ] Target database integration

### Phase 5: Refinement and Optimization

- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Mobile experience enhancement
- [ ] User preference system
- [ ] Comprehensive help documentation
- [ ] Offline capabilities

## Known Issues

As development has not yet begun, there are no implementation-specific issues. However, we have identified several challenges that will need to be addressed:

1. **WebSocket Reliability**: Ensuring stable connections with automatic reconnection in case of network interruptions.

2. **Equipment Compatibility**: Supporting a wide range of astronomy equipment with different capabilities and parameters.

3. **Real-time Performance**: Maintaining responsive UI while handling frequent updates from equipment.

4. **Image Data Handling**: Efficiently transferring and displaying potentially large image files.

5. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers and devices.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

As the project progresses, this section will track significant decisions and their evolution. Currently, we have made the following foundational decisions:

### Technology Stack Selection

We evaluated several options for the frontend framework and state management:

1. **Frontend Framework**:
   - **React**: Selected for its component model, virtual DOM, and ecosystem
   - **Angular**: Considered but rejected due to steeper learning curve
   - **Vue**: Considered but React's TypeScript support was preferred

2. **State Management**:
   - **Zustand**: Selected for simplicity and performance
   - **Redux**: Considered but deemed too verbose for our needs
   - **Context API**: Considered but performance concerns with frequent updates

3. **UI Component Library**:
   - **Gravity UI**: Selected for comprehensive component set and design
   - **Material UI**: Considered but Gravity UI better matched our design needs
   - **Chakra UI**: Considered but lacked some specialized components we need

### Architecture Approach

We considered different architectural approaches:

1. **Communication Protocol**:
   - **WebSocket**: Selected for real-time bidirectional communication
   - **REST API**: Will be used as a complement for non-real-time operations
   - **GraphQL**: Considered but deemed unnecessary for our use case

2. **Component Organization**:
   - **Feature-based**: Selected to group related components by feature
   - **Type-based**: Rejected as it would separate related components
   - **Atomic Design**: Elements of this approach will be incorporated

As development progresses, this document will be updated to reflect new decisions, changes to existing decisions, and the rationale behind them.

## Next Immediate Steps

The following tasks are the immediate focus for development:

1. Complete the development environment setup:
   - Finalize ESLint and Prettier configuration
   - Set up testing infrastructure
   - Configure Storybook

2. Implement the WebSocket connection manager:
   - Create the connection establishment logic
   - Implement message serialization/deserialization
   - Develop reconnection handling

3. Build the basic state management stores:
   - Connection state store
   - Equipment state store
   - UI state store

4. Create the application shell:
   - Implement the main layout
   - Develop the navigation component
   - Build the theme switching functionality

Progress on these tasks will be tracked and updated in this document.
