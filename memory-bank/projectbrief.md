# Project Brief: Indigo Web UI

## Project Overview
The Indigo Web UI is a web-based user interface for the indigosky server, which is used for astrophotography automation. The UI will allow users to control and monitor various astronomical equipment, view images, and automate astrophotography workflows.

## Core Requirements

### Functionality
1. Connect to and communicate with the indigosky server
2. Provide access to all parameters of the astrophotography equipment
3. Control equipment through specialized panels:
   - Mount control
   - Auto guiding
   - Imaging
   - Focusing
   - Astrometric solve plating

### User Experience
1. Intuitive and responsive interface for both desktop and mobile devices
2. Real-time updates of equipment status and parameters
3. Visual feedback for operations (e.g., image previews, status indicators)
4. Efficient workflows for common astrophotography tasks

### Technical Requirements
1. Built with React and TypeScript
2. Utilize Gravity UI kit for consistent design
3. State management with Zustand
4. Responsive design for various screen sizes
5. Efficient communication with the indigosky server

## Project Goals
1. Create a modern, user-friendly interface for controlling astrophotography equipment
2. Simplify complex astrophotography workflows
3. Provide real-time feedback and monitoring of equipment
4. Enable remote operation of astrophotography setups
5. Support a wide range of astronomical equipment through the indigosky server

## Target Users
- Amateur astronomers
- Astrophotographers
- Astronomy enthusiasts
- Research institutions
- Educational facilities

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully connect to and control equipment through the indigosky server
2. Intuitive UI that requires minimal training to use
3. Stable and responsive performance
4. Support for all major equipment types
5. Positive user feedback on usability and functionality
